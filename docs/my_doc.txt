University College London (UCL) – Research Brief 2025

UCL’s Department of Computer Science is spearheading several initiatives in machine learning, natural‑language processing and responsible AI. 
Highlights include:

• The UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence has released a new benchmark for retrieval‑augmented generation that measures factual consistency across 42 domains.

• Researchers at UCL and Moorfields Eye Hospital have developed a computer‑vision pipeline that detects diabetic retinopathy with 92 % accuracy, using self‑supervised pre‑training to reduce labelling costs by 70 %.

• In 2024, UCL partnered with the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre to launch the London Cyber Nexus – a programme that combines LangChain‑style autonomous agents with live threat‑intel streams.  
  – First results show a 38 % reduction in triage time for phishing incidents.  
  – The programme also released an open‑source vector‑database plugin based on FAISS and ChromaDB.

Upcoming Challenges (2025–2027)
1. Aligning large language models to comply with the EU AI Act while preserving open‑source transparency.  
2. Scaling retrieval pipelines for multi‑modal input (text + images + audio) in low‑resource environments.  
3. Ethical governance for generative agents that autonomously write or refactor code in production.

Take‑away: UCL is positioning itself as a bridge between cutting‑edge research and real‑world, regulation‑aware deployment in AI and cyber security.
